Reinforcement Learning Project

This project explores how reinforcement learning works when combined with function approximation. Instead of using large tables to store values for every possible state, the agent learns using an approximator that can generalize across similar states. This makes the learning process more efficient and scalable.

The notebook in this repository walks through the core ideas of TD learning, bootstrapping, and how value predictions are improved over time. Everything is explained step-by-step in a way that beginners can follow along easily.

What This Project Includes

A clear explanation of reinforcement learning with function approximation

TD(0) learning used to update value estimates
